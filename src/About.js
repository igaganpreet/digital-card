            <p>
                I love sharing knowledge and skills with others and this lead to my decision of being a teacher. But somewhere deep down my heart I had an inclination towards programming which resulted in my decision of experimenting with web development. I am a passionate learner working on my skills and growing as a front-end developer each and every day.
